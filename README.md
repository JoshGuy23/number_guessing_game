# number_guessing_game

This is a game in which the user must guess a number from 1 to 100. If the user gets the guess wrong, they lose a life and get feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low. The number of lives the user has depends on the difficulty they select at the start of the game.

The main file is "number_guessing_game.py", while "art.py" is a supplemental file.

This project is meant to demonstrate the Python skills I have learned thus far.
